# Generic-Node-Trees-Traversing-Breadth-First-Search-and-Depth-First-Search
This was an assignment I completed for my Advanced Computer Science class. The assignment involved creating a Tree class that accepted generic types as well as programming numerous methods such as a method that executed a breadth first search, one that executed a depth first search iteratively, one that executed a depth first search recursively, and many that traversed the tree in different ways. 

This program was created using Java and was tested/run using Terminal.
